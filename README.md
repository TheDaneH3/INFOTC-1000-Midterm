# INFOTC-1000-Midterm

Welcome to the homepage of my INFOTC-1000 Module 9 Midterm submission. I hope you enjoy your stay.

There are a few pages included. Feel free to explore them!

Interested in learning more about my rabbit, [Peaches](Peaches.md)?

Or perhaps you might want to visit my page about my [typewriter collection](Typewriters.md)?

There is also a page about [birds](Birds.md)!

And finally, there is a page with a few snippets of [code](Code.md).
