My typewriter collection has grown *considerably* over the years. This page contains a list of my typewriters and a few images of my favorites.

My collection of typewriters consists of:

* 2 x IBM Selectric I 
* 2 x IBM Selectric II
* IBM Selectric Portable
* IBM Wheelwriter 5
* IBM Wheelwriter 10
* IBM Wheelwriter 70 Series II
* Olympia SM9 Deluxe
* Smith Corona Sterling Automatic 12
* Royal Ensign Portable

This is my favorite typewriter, the IBM Wheelwriter 70 Series II. It is built with an integrated word processor and file storage system. The operating system is a relative to the IBM OS/2 system, but predates it. Like all other Wheelwriter models, it types based on the IBM Wheelwriter cartridge system. The cartridges are interchangeable, which allows for the use of a large variety of fonts.

My other favorite typewriter is the (Selectric) IBM Personal.
