## My Typewriter Collection

[Return to homepage](README.ml)

My typewriter collection has grown *considerably* over the years. This page contains a list of my typewriters and a few images of my favorites.

This is my favorite typewriter, the IBM Wheelwriter 70 Series II. It is built with an integrated word processor and file storage system. The operating system is a relative to the IBM OS/2 system, but predates it.
